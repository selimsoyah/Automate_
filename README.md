Quick Reminder : 
    in order to run the server with nodemon {all you have to is type "npm run dev"};
    this will make it easier for you , instead of relaunching the server everytime !
    BTW make sure to create a file .env in your backend folder , just for security !!!
    no need to add it in the frontend folder it may cause some problems just type the IP address and the server port manually !!
    The content of .env should be as followed :

    {
        serverport : 'your port',
        user:'your db user',
        host:'your host',
        password:'your db password ',
        database:'the name of your schema',
        port:'your db port',

    }
